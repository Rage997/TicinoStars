# TicinoStars

Iteractive map of Ticino and its 9 Michelin stars made for a summer project in collaboration with Sapori Ticino under the supervision of Universita' della Svizzera Italiana. Our group of 3 students, each from a different Master, aimed to deliver a set of proposals to the 9 Michelin stars in Ticino. In particular, we focalised on organised an event aimed at young people who are, generally speaking, not accustomed to such foods. 

In the end, due to a lack of time, the website never got completed but may be used as a template for future work (and was a nice occasion to learn the mapbox GL API!)
